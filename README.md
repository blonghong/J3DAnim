# J3DAnim 

J3DAnim is a tool used to convert Maya's ASCII animation format to Nintendo's J3D animation format.

Things you need to follow:
Load your .anim in your preferred text editor and write "EOF" and the very end. The tool will not work if you don't do so.
Make sure your bones are in order, both in Maya, and the .anim you're trying to convert.

The BMD model has to be in the same directory as the .anim file.

This can be used for all sorts of things, so I hope you use this wisely! :}
